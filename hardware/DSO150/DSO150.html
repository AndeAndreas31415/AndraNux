	<p>I wanted to have battery operation at my <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=DSO150">DSO150</a>.<br/>
	Without which I have to add a 9V block afterwards.<br/>

	That's why I thought why don't I just do it myself, that upgrade.<br/>
	I just screwed it on to see what's in there.<br/>

	<img src="3.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	I saw such a beautiful 2pin socket and thought there can be something.<br/>
	Because I didn't have a fit plug and didn't want to solder on the socket.<br/>
	I just soldered the socket.<br/>

	What do you need for the Ozi an Akkuozi?<br/>
	1.Battery with <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=battery+charger+module">charging module</a><br/>
	2.<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=step+up+converter">Stepup converter</a><br/>
	<img src="6.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	I would like to isolate the free contacts at the bottom.<br/>
	That's why I glued a piece of isoband ran.<br/>
	<img src="7.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	Then I connected the outputs of the charging module to the inputs of the Stepup converter.<br/>
	<img src="8.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	The output of the stepup converter I soldered to where the socket was ran.<br/>
	<img src="9.jpg" alt=""></img>
	<img src="10.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	Because I had to attach the 2 small boards to the large board I glued more isoband down.<br/>
	<img src="11.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	After bem I have attached everything to the board.<br/>
	<img src="12.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	Is it time to reassemble that.<br/>
	Finally, I carved a charging socket for the charging module.<br/>
	<img src="13.jpg" alt=""></img><br/><br/>
	<br/>
	Conclusion: It works with the battery. For the long run, it will show how many times I have to load it.<br/>

    Hello, that here is a cookie text. <br>
    <br>
    I would advise you to open the website at a Recher/Pc. <br>
    Just respect that you read this here. <br>
    I just want to ask you here if you accept a cookie. <br>
    <i>The cookie is only there for whether you want to see <b>this message</b> always or not.</i> <br>
    <br>
    You can also display all cookies on the website. <br>
    Use this command on the <u>document.cookie</u> console. <br>
    If you want to delete the cookie, you only have to enter "<u>document.cookie="cookie="cookie=; secure" </u>" in the console. <br>
